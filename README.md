This tool is a proof of concept application of a methodology for compliance checking of building projects, focussing on accessibility. This tool was developed for my masters thesis, which can be consulted at https://lib.ugent.be/catalog/rug01:003063643.

## Installation
Download the ZIP folder of this repository, or clone it by running `git clone https://github.com/NuytsE/ACC-front` in a terminal.
Do the same for the backend of the application, on `https://github.com/NuytsE/ACC-back`.

Run `npm install` in both of the folders. 
Run `npm start` in the frontend folder, and `npm run dev` in the backend folder.

## Use
You can upload a LBD graph of a building project.

This can either lead to a non-conforming validation report.

Or to a conforming validation report.

If you do not have a LBD graph to upload, you can directly go to `https:localhost:3000/report` to view the validation report of a student project, used in the corresponding thesis for the demonstration.
